    "Definition": [
        "Given a sentence in English, provide the sentiment based on its empathetic direction. There are two possible classifications happy or offmychest (i.e. positive vs. negative)."

    "Positive Examples": [

            "input": "was down for a long time , wanted to show off what changed all that , my mermaid hair .",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "In this context, this would be classified as positive sentiment since the speaker disjuncts \"was down for a long time\" with their new changed hair insinuating a positive sentiment; therefore, it is correctly classified."

            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "In this context, this would be classified as negative sentiment since the speaker uses strong negative connotative words such as \"hate\", \"wasting\", \"rather\", etc; so, it is classified correctly"

        {

            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "In this context, it is not correctly classified as the speaker mentions extreme feelings of happiness after stopping a negative habit and use of the word \"proud\""

        {
            "input": "i hate . i hate that i feel in love with the person i consider my best friend . i hate the fact that i know the only way i can stop having stop these feelings is to completely remove her from my life . i hate the fact that its going that its going to hurt us . i hate that i 've to come to this decision",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "In this context, the example is incorrectly classified as positive even though the speaker uses strong negatively-connotated words such as \"hate\", \"stop\", \"remove\", and \"hurt\"."
